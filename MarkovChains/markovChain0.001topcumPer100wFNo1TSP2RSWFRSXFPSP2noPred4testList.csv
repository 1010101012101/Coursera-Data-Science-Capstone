Winter is the best time to do this and, as a result, get answers for yourself about whatever concerns you. It is also a tremendously creative time, a time for artists of all kinds to turn within and to seek images of forms he or she wishes to produce in whatever medium chosen, so that an image of balance can be presented. Those of you that write, we suggest that you do so to come up with plots and ideas that will speak of balance coming to an imbalanced situation, person, or world. To those of you who, like Priscilla, work with making patterns and designs, we would say remember the images and designs brought about by winter. White will challenge you to see what changes will manifest in the images you produce.

Secondly, I finally began moving in with my boyfriend of four years, and that‚Äôs a bit nerve-wrecking. As for reading books, the last week of April gave me an opportunity to relax and enjoy a few stories. As you will see, I have not finished much, but I have successfully began several hefty novels. I am happy with the progress I‚Äôve made so far and the quality of books I‚Äôve picked to read. The Fellowship of the Ring is surprisingly easy to read, considering all my fears about Tolkien and his writing. I am loving A Clash of Kings even though this season took a few liberties concerning the plot. Master and Margarita is my first Russian novel in a long time, and I have to say it‚Äôs surprisingly refreshing. I had to postpone my Virginia Woolf experience for later, as I find that I am just not in the mood for it. I should be returning to it a bit later.","april was a month for new beginnings firstly i finally finished my exams and if all is good i‚Äôll be graduating in may it still feels weird to know that the business degree i‚Äôve been working for four years is finally mine so",44,"now","now","4","now","3","so","41C","now","31A",0.280000000006112,TRUE

They evidence the strong influence of the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law in language, doctrine, norms, and principles. In a number of places the Rwandan canons clearly are repudiation of the Thirty-Nine Articles and of authentic historic Anglicanism, and embrace in their place the dogmas of the Council of Trent. The provisions governing the relationship of the Rwandan Primate with Anglican Primatial Vicar Chuck Murphy are based upon the provisions of the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law governing the relationship of the Pope to lesser bishops of the Roman Catholic Church. This causes me also to wonder what part Donlan himself played in their formulation.","i wonder what kevin donlan has in mind when he speaks of ‚Äúa new model for a new day‚Äù i have finished a careful study of the new rwandan canons and the anglican mission",35,"canonical","canonical","2","mission","31B","mission","21","primatial","21",0.220000000001164,TRUE
