We made him count all of his money to make sure that he had enough! It was very cute to watch his reaction when he realized he did! He also does a very good job of letting Lola feel like she is playing too, by letting her switch out the characters!

It could also get very bad as far as loss of individual liberty. A lot of people will blame it on capitalism, on freedom, and they will claim we need more government. It could be used as an impetus for more regulation, which would be a disaster, or it could be an impetus to get rid of all the regulation that was causing the problem. But whether we will do the right or the wrong thing here in America, there will be a lot of pain first.

It still feels weird to know that the business degree I’ve been working for four years is finally mine. So now I’m in the process of looking for a new job. Secondly, I finally began moving in with my boyfriend of four years, and that’s a bit nerve-wrecking. As for reading books, the last week of April gave me an opportunity to relax and enjoy a few stories. As you will see, I have not finished much, but I have successfully began several hefty novels. I am happy with the progress I’ve made so far and the quality of books I’ve picked to read. The Fellowship of the Ring is surprisingly easy to read, considering all my fears about Tolkien and his writing. I am loving A Clash of Kings even though this season took a few liberties concerning the plot. Master and Margarita is my first Russian novel in a long time, and I have to say it’s surprisingly refreshing. I had to postpone my Virginia Woolf experience for later, as I find that I am just not in the mood for it. I should be returning to it a bit later.","april was a month for new beginnings firstly i finally finished my exams and if all is good i’ll be graduating in may it still feels weird to know that the business degree i’ve been working for four years is finally mine so now i’m in the process of looking for a new job secondly i finally began moving in with my boyfriend of four years and that’s a bit nervewrecking as for reading books the last week of april gave me an opportunity to relax and enjoy a few stories as you will see i have not finished much but i have successfully began several hefty novels i am happy with the progress i’ve made so far and the quality of books i’ve picked to read the fellowship of the ring is surprisingly easy to read considering all my fears about tolkien and his writing i am loving a clash of kings even though this season took a few liberties concerning the plot master and margarita is my first russian novel",173,"in","a","3","novel","31B","russian","42F","a","2","russian","32C","in","3","long","2","in","21",0.0599999999976717,TRUE

The band, who play both loose and funky without ever sounding sloppy, helped produce a more laid back vibe and Chandler sounds more relaxed than he did on the earlier album. He has some better songs on this one, too, such as the title cut warm, poppy number about...well, “Lovin’ People,” on which the presence of a chorus (made up on the spot of people who had gathered to provide assistance to a mothers’ help organization) also helps temper Chandler’s unfortunate tendency towards over-earnestness. “The Naked Fool” is about a relationship gone bad, which doesn’t have anything new to say but will have a few toes tapping. “Sold Out, No More Reservations” is an interesting number about a male groupie, and “Bound to Fly” has a nice soaring quality, and Chandler’s lyrics and delivery mesh well on it. If anything the problem here is that Chandler is sometimes eclipsed by his backing band—check “Behind Your Eyes” where the band goes off on some nice free jazz-psychedelic tangents while Chandler seems to be trying to channel Sammy Davis, Jr.","on the lovin’ people he has the benefit of a good backing band consisting of pretty purdie on drums artie butler on piano and joe mack and bill salter on bass the band who play both",37,"loose","loose","4","both","41C","and","3","loose","31A","play","42F","loose","31B","and","2","who","2",0.0700000000069849,TRUE
