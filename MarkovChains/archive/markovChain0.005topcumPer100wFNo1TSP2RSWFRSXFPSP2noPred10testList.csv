Suddenly, for the last seven minutes, the characters we have come to know have disappeared ‚Äî and yet the film continues. We see deserted streets, shadows, anonymous strangers.

There are some wide, long takes from above that slowly pan around as if surveying the streets. Trees rustle in the wind. A man in a suit rounds a corner. A toddler looks up at his mother. A close up of a man‚Äôs earlobe. A stream of water flows into the gutter. ‚ÄúYes, what is it Antonioni?‚Äù I remember thinking, ‚ÄúWhat are you trying to show us?‚Äù I was searching for meaning, for story.

"550","Description and History ‚Äì There is little left of this canal side church but it boasts a long history. A church was originally located here in the 8th century when Irish monks were establishing many communities in the area. The present structure is late medieval and may not have had a long period of usage as the Penal Laws brought an end to Catholic worship here as it did to many other churches throughout Ireland. The present church is badly ruined and measures 16m x 7.5m. The E and W walls survive to full height but the N wall has collapsed in recent years destroying very fine Latin inscribed gravestone underneath it. The graveyard contains some very nice gravestones.","description and history ‚Äì there is little left of this canal side church but it boasts a long history a church was originally located here in the",28,"th","world","end","past","same","middle","first","morning","last","day","th",0.0199999999967986,TRUE

First, Warner points to and Halperin fleshes out how the insistence on ‚ÄúGay Pride‚Äù can actually serve to deepen the shame gay men feel about their desires and practices, by re-relegating them to the closet in contra-distinction to an out-and-proud gay-maleness. Second, Halperin turns to a right-wing French writer, Marcel Jouhandeau, who extolled the virtues of social abjection and, in particular, humiliation at being different: Jouhandeau (and later, Genet) turn abjection on its head, into a kind of sacrilization of abjection. To tease this out, thirdly, Halperin explicates two scenes from Jean Genet‚Äôs opus, in which Genet depicts social abjection, humiliation, as a process and where the abjected, humiliated subject responds by resignifying the abjection as either a source of pleasure or as the signifying source of his difference. In Halperin‚Äôs interpretation, Genet‚Äôs narrators find freedom precisely by identifying with their abjection and embracing it, refusing its deleterious effects and instead creating for themselves a re-signifying and life-affirming defiance. The more they are humiliated, the more defiant and ecstatic the narrators become. Genet‚Äôs narrative insists that loving someone who is humiliated (socially abject) requires the loving of their abjection itself.","halperin‚Äôs insights are manifold in this rich section of the book here i list those that were most salient to me as i read first warner points to and halperin fleshes out how the insistence on ‚Äú pride‚Äù can actually serve to deepen the shame men feel about their desires and practices by rerelegating them to the closet in contradistinction to an outandproud maleness second halperin turns to a rightwing french writer marcel jouhandeau who extolled the virtues of social abjection and in particular humiliation at being different jouhandeau and later genet turn abjection on its head into a kind of sacrilization of abjection to tease this out thirdly halperin explicates",112,"two","two",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.0400000000008731,TRUE

I‚Äôm not sure how unusual our taste in music is, but there does seem to be a hunger in our family for listening to exotic phonemes.
